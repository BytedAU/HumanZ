Company Launches
Routine iOS: Sunrise + Todoist + Notion
See original launch post
‚è© tl;dr
Routine iOS is available!

‚õ∞Ô∏è Problem
Busy professionals waste a lot of time juggling between many apps to manage their work: tasks, calendars, notes, contacts, projects etc.

Many use Apple Notes for taking notes, which then must later be copied & organized in a team knowledge base (e.g Notion).
Other use a task manager (e.g Todoist) to quickly create tasks instead of creating a ticket in the collaborative platform (e.g Asana)
Meetings notes are rarely taken because it is too much of a hassle. And if done, one must then manually create tickets to represent the meeting‚Äôs action items
And calendars do not allow to overview, prioritize and plan work even though they are the prime representation of time
‚Ä¶ and so on and so forth
üì± Solution
Routine is an all-in-one productivity app which brings your work from third-party services (email, chat, project management etc.) next to your calendar to better overview, prioritize and plan.

With Routine, calendars, tasks, notes & contacts are connected for information you create to be organized and linked to time.



Give it a try here!

Hope you like it.
