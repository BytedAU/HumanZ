Routine combines tasks, calendar management, and documentation in a UI that enables optimal week-to-week planning. My favorite feature is the dashboard, where I can quickly capture things that otherwise would fall through the cracks.

I don't know how I lived before Routine App, I have tried so many productivity apps, note apps, tasks, and calendars. These guys created a very simple super app that has removed 90% of my stress and time waste.

Routine is so refreshingly thoughtful, not to mention keyboard-centric. I really do hope they keep the momentum and bring their vision to life (cross-platform).

Routine has helped me clearly map out my day. It reduces the noise of multiple calendars and long-term task lists into a one-day agenda view of what I can accomplish today. Routine provides me with a focused runway for the day.
