What Individual Users say about Motion
Find time for a workaholic
I work ~375 hours a month. Keeping up with work, volunteer, and personal life tasks has become a challenge, and I have been consistently dropping the ball. I have found that with Motion I am dropping that ball less and staying much more focused on what needs to be done, rather than trying to figure out what needs to be done.
Vanessa G (Verified User on G2)


The Happiness Algorithm
I don’t usually write reviews. But Motion is revolutionary. The happiness algorithm they promote states it will help you: feel accomplished, get serious stuff done, and relax and sleep better. Check, check, and check. After week and half of use, I think my productivity is up 10x.

Changed my life.
Motion helps me be reasonable with my time. Before Motion, I was just go-go-go. Now, I realize how much I am putting on my plate and how unreasonable I'm being. Motion helps me prioritize my tasks and keep me on track. I use it everyday.
Charlotte R (Verified User on G20)


This app is a game changer
I run a commercial commercial construction company and this app has been a game changer. As far as organization time management and project timelines it is phenomenal. This is probably the only application I use on a daily basis to help organize jobs tasks within jobs and my weekly schedule.

Motion has been my best friend in overcoming executive dysfunction.
I struggle greatly with procrastination and Motion has been instrumental in my academic and professional successes. Motion has taken the stress away from planning my daily workflow and it has helped me avoid many instances of execution paralysis. This has helped me enjoy my free time more, knowing that I will be able to get everything done on time.
Kate B (Verified User on G2)


Motion: The app that helps me manage my ADHD
As someone­ with ADHD who struggles to stay focused and organized, I found gre­at joy in discovering the Motion app. This invaluable tool has be­come a lifeline, allowing me to effectively manage­ projects, priorities, and schedule­s — while accommodating my ADHD brain.
Francis M (Verified User on G2)


The current tool I'm in love with is @useMotion
I used to work 60 hours per week and beat myself to the point of depression but now I work ~40 with same productivity

Not only is it my literal personal assistant scheduling tasks for me, but it rearranges them when life happens
@taayjus


After a few days with @useMotion, I can see this becoming my go-to app
I dumped all of my tasks into the app with some hard and soft deadlines and it managed to schedule my days beautifully. If things come up and I can't complete the task, it gets re-shuffled!
@MarkPoppen


Use it everyday
Originally, I trialed Motion and a competing app. I decided to go with the competitor. But after several months, I had an epiphany of why Motion was better. It handled rescheduling in a much more automated and intuitive way! I switched back and I use it to plan everything.
